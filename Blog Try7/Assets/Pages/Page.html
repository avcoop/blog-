  <h2><article>Steelers had seven selections in the 2024 NFL Draft, selecting four offensive players and three defensive players.</h2>

   <p>They kicked things off by drafting Washington offensive tackle Troy Fautanu, while adding two other offensive linemen in center Zach Frazier from West Virginia in the second round, and guard Mason McCormick from South Dakota State in the fourth round.</p>
    
    <p><strong>"We'll give them an opportunity to (play), but needless to say we're really excited about having them," said Steelers head coach Mike Tomlin. "We had some testy moments there leading up to our picks but that's a good thing from my perspective. It means we had guys on our board that we're excited about the potential of taking, and I think in all three of those instances we were really excited." </strong></p>
<p> The picks didn't stop with the offensive line. The Steelers addressed receiver by taking Michigan's Roman Wilson in the third round, and defense wasn't forgotten either. The Steelers selected North Carolina State linebacker Payton Wilson in the third round, Iowa defensive end Logan Lee in the sixth round and Texas defensive back Ryan Watts in the sixth round.</p>
<p> "Very pleased how the weekend turned out for us," said General Manager Omar Khan. "We addressed some needs, but really got some high-character guys and some players that we think are going to help us not only this year, but in the future and are going to be great parts of this community."</p>
